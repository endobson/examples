Start cloud run service and after failure to bind on ports look at logs.
These are sometimes a minute or two stale.

The observed behavior is the first request fails with a 500 error, the second
succeeds, and the third succeeds. The third is the same request as the first.

My experimenting has shown that it seems to be that it is the shutdown call
that causes the problem. But since it seems like it can get into a good state,
and answer the same request ok some of the time, I cannot blackbox debug it well.

The initial presentation of the problem showed that it was the /token endpoint
that was affected, other urls were fine.
